# ppdb2xml

ppdb2xml is simple tool which outputs xml informations stored inside .exe/.dll and .pdb file(new portable pdb format).

All source code is take from offical roslyn repository. Because it seemed like too much work to compile library :).

For convince I included already compiled ppdb2xml.exe into repository which already has all needed .dlls ILRepacked into it...

Enjoy debugging debugging file.
